# Log File Analyzer â€“ Detect Failed Logins & Suspicious Activity

This Python script analyzes system log files to identify:

- Repeated failed login attempts
- Potential brute-force IP addresses
- Suspicious log entries (e.g. "unauthorized", "denied", etc.)

It generates a clean, readable report and optionally saves it to a text file for further review.

## Features

- Uses regex to detect failed login attempts from system logs
- Flags IP addresses with repeated login failures (customizable threshold)
- Searches for general suspicious activity based on keywords
- Generates a summary report in the terminal and a `log_analysis_report.txt` file
- Includes a dummy log generator for testing
